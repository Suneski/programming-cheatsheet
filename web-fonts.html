        <h1>WEB FONTS</h1>
        <p>There are several "Web Safe" fonts that most browsers can read (for a list of these fonts, click <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp">here</a>).</p>
        <p>But what if was want to use a different font? Maybe we want a font more elegant than "cursive," or maybe a font reminiscent of video games from the 80s. Other sites have been able to use far more varied fonts.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorites include:</p>

        <div class="sample-text">
          <p id="vt323">VT323</p>
          <p id="press-start">Press Start 2P</p>
          <p id="orbitron">Orbitron</p>
        </div>

        <p>But how do you do such wizardry?! Well, there are a couple of methods.</p>

        <p>(Just a quick note, when you use font-family with these fonts, include some "Web Safe" fonts as back up, in case there is a server issue.)</p>

        <h2>@font-face</h2>
        <p>When Best to Use This Method: When using a font from your own server/computer</p>
        <p>How to Use: In your CSS file, type "@font-face" followed by your curly brackets. Inside of your brackets, you will need to include "font-family:" with the name of the font, as well as "src: url()" with the font file's location in your parenthesis.</p>
        <p>From there, just use "font-family:" and the font-name anywhere in your CSS file.</p>
        <p class="note">NOTE: @import must be included at the top of your CSS file.</p>

        <h2>@import</h2>
        <p>When Best to Use This Method: When using a font from an external server</p>
        <p>How to Use: In your CSS file, type "@import url('')" with the URL for the font between the single-quotes. You do not use curly brackets when using @import.</p>
        <p>Once your @import has been set up, you can just use "font-family:" and the font-name anywhere in your CSS file.</p>
        <p>Many sites that offer fonts, including Google Fonts, will have the @import line ready for you to copy/paste.</p>
        <p class="note">NOTE: As with using @font-face, @import must be included at the top of your CSS file.</p>

        <h2>&lt;link&gt;ing in HTML"</h2>
        <p>When Best to Use This Method: When you'd rather add the font via HTML than CSS</p>
        <p>How to Use: In your &lt;head&gt; section, create a &lt;link&gt; tag. Set an "href" to the font's URL, and set "rel" to stylesheet. From there, you can use "font-family:" with the font name in your CSS.</p>
        <p class="note">NOTE: Google Fonts, as well as other sites, will have the &lt;link&gt; line ready for you to copy/paste.</p>
